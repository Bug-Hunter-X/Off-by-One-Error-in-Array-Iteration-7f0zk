This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from using `i <= arr.length` in the loop condition instead of `i < arr.length`.  This leads to an attempt to access an array element beyond the valid index range. The corrected version fixes this by using the correct condition to prevent the out-of-bounds access.
